## Description
Throughout the game, the difficulty will randomly change. Upon the difficulty being changed, no player will be notified. This can make for some very unique moments with your friends!

The times of these changes are random, and the range between them is dependant on the level of difficulty. Read below of the ranges of times in seconds and if you have any suggestions on the times, please let me know in the comments!

## Random Difficulty Change Time Ranges (In Seconds):
Easy = {min = 45, max = 60},<br />
Normal = {min = 15, max = 45},<br />
Advanced = {min = 15, max = 45},<br />
Expert = {min = 45, max = 60}<br />

## Compatibility
Currently this mutation works on every campaign as far as I am aware, if there any bugs please let me know!
